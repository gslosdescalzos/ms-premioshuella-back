Create a new endpoint called "/api/v1/email" that would accept a json with an email, name, surname and comments.

This endpoint would handle possible user enquiries, they will fill a form on frontend and send questions or whatever. This new endpoint should get that information from user and send an email to descalzos@mscjerez.es. I want to send that email from my personal account.
